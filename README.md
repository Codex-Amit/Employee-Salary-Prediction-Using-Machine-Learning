## üöÄ Features

- ‚úÖ Upload custom dataset and train the model.
- ‚úÖ Predict salary for a single employee via form input.
- ‚úÖ Batch prediction via CSV file upload.
- ‚úÖ Clean preprocessing, outlier handling, and feature engineering.
- ‚úÖ Uses `GradientBoostingClassifier` with scaling and encoding.

## ü§ñ ML Models Implemented

The following machine learning algorithms were tested:

- Logistic Regression
- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
- Support Vector Machine (SVM)
- Random Forest Classifier
- Gradient Boosting Classifier

Evaluation metrics:
- Accuracy Score
- Confusion Matrix
- Classification Report

## üß† Deep Learning Approach

A feed-forward Neural Network was built using **TensorFlow/Keras**:

- Layers: Dense layers with ReLU activation
- Optimizer: Adam
- Metrics: Accuracy
- Additional techniques: Dropout, Batch Normalization

## üìÅ Project Structure
```yaml
Employee-Salary-Prediction-Using-Machine-Learning/
‚îÇ
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ salary_prediction_app.py     # Main Gradio application
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ _Employee_Salary_Prediction.ipynb     # Jupyter notebook version
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ adult.csv     # Sample dataset (UCI Adult Dataset)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ requirements.txt     # List of dependencies
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ README.md     # Project documentation
```
#### # Note that the python version should be of version 3.12.0. As tensorflow is used in the project which supports only version upto 3.12.0. And using above it may cause error or may don't give the accurate result.

## üì• Dataset Requirements
For training or batch prediction, your CSV should contain these columns:
```text
age, workclass, education-num, marital-status, occupation, relationship,
race, gender, capital-gain, capital-loss, hours-per-week, native-country
```

## üêõ Troubleshooting

#### Solutions to some common problems you might face

### ‚ùó 1. `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'gradio'`

**Cause**: Required Python packages not installed.

**Solution**:
#### Run the following command to install dependencies:
```yaml
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### ‚ùó 2. FileNotFoundError: [Errno 2] No such file or directory: 'adult.csv'
**Cause**: Training file not found or not uploaded.

Solution:
Make sure to:

Upload adult.csv in the Model Training tab.

Or provide your own CSV file in the correct format.
