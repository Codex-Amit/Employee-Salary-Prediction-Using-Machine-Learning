## üìÅ Project Structure
```yaml
Employee-Salary-Prediction-Using-Machine-Learning/
‚îÇ
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ salary_prediction_app.py     # Main Gradio application
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ _Employee_Salary_Prediction.ipynb     # Jupyter notebook version
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ adult.csv     # Sample dataset (UCI Adult Dataset)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ requirements.txt     # List of dependencies
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ README.md     # Project documentation
```
#### # Note that the python version should be of version 3.12.0. As tensorflow is used in the project which supports only version upto 3.12.0. And using above it may cause error or may don't give the accurate result.

## üì• Dataset Requirements
For training or batch prediction, your CSV should contain these columns:
```text
age, workclass, education-num, marital-status, occupation, relationship,
race, gender, capital-gain, capital-loss, hours-per-week, native-country
```

## üêõ Troubleshooting

#### Solutions to some common problems you might face

### ‚ùó 1. `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'gradio'`

**Cause**: Required Python packages not installed.

**Solution**:
#### Run the following command to install dependencies:
```yaml
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### ‚ùó 2. `FileNotFoundError: [Errno 2] No such file or directory: 'adult.csv'`
**Cause**: Training file not found or not uploaded.

**Solution**:
Make sure to:

- Upload adult.csv in the Model Training tab.

- Provide your own CSV file in the correct format.

### ‚ùó 3. `ValueError: could not convert string to float`
 **Cause :** Incorrect column data types or unexpected missing values.
 
 **Solution:**
- Ensure your CSV file has valid numeric values for numeric columns.
- Avoid blank rows or unexpected strings.
- Use the provided adult.csv format as a template.

### ‚ùó 4. `Model not trained yet. Please upload training data first`
 **Cause:** Attempting prediction before training the model.

 **Solution:**

- First upload a training dataset and click on "Train Model".

- Then proceed to Single or Batch Prediction.

### ‚ùó 5. `App doesn't launch or crashes immediately`
**Solution:**

- Check Python version (recommended: Python 3.8+).

- Ensure all libraries are installed correctly.

- Run the script with `python salary_prediction_app.py` not `.ipynb`
